## Notice

This program is currently in development state. No documentation or support is available.
But this is hopefully going to change in the future (:


#### FTL
FTL (*"Fold the line"*) is a program developed to turn flat circuit layouts done in KiCad into 3D models and bend them.
The exported geometries can be used to do simulations, measure dimensions, design enclosures etc.
